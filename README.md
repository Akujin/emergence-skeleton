# emergence-skeleton-v1

## Roadmap

### Immediate

- [X] Upgrade dwoo to v1.4
- [ ] Get Dwoo 1.4 plugin loading working with emergence
    - Current hurdle: some plugins are bare functions, can't be autoloaded..asked Daniel about this on gitter
    - Got custom loader able to load dwoo-native function-based plugins, but even with loader worknig Dwoo doesn't seem to be currently capable of utilizing plugins outside the Dwoo\Plugins namespace
